Difference between class components and Functional components:

CLASS COMPONENTS:
     Class components are the traditional way to create React components. They are written as JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class. Class components can have state and lifecycle methods.


FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS:
    Functional components are a newer way to create React components. They are simply JavaScript functions that accept props and return React elements. Functional components cannot have state or lifecycle methods.
